This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving an infinite loop within a useEffect hook. The bug occurs due to improper state updates within the dependency array of the useEffect, leading to a continuous re-render and state change. The solution involves restructuring the conditional logic to prevent the infinite loop by only updating the state under specific conditions that do not trigger the dependency again.
